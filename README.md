# Sample Spring Cloud Config for the WiredMeters Registry

This is a sample repository used by the [WiredMeters Registry](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-registry).

When running the WiredMeters Registry with the `git` profile, it uses this sample repository by default, and will serve the `application.yml` file that is located at the root directory.
